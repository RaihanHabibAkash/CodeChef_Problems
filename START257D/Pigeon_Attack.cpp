Chef is tired of pigeons invading his balcony, and so decides to put up a net to keep them out.

It takes 
N
N minutes of work to put up the net.
However, the pigeons won't leave Chef alone - every 
K
K-th minute, they'll fly onto the balcony and annoy Chef, leaving him unable to work.

That is, on minutes 
K

…
K,2K,3K,… Chef is unable to progress putting up the net.

How many minutes in total, including delays, will Chef need to finish putting up the net?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers 
N
N and 
K
K.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the total number of minutes needed for the net to be put up.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: Chef needs 
N
=
3
N=3 minutes and the pigeons will show up every second minute, i.e. minutes 
2
,
4
,
6
,
…
2,4,6,…

Minute 
1
1: Chef will do some work.
Minute 
2
2: Chef is unable to work due to pigeons.
Minute 
3
3: Chef will do some work.
Minute 
4
4: Chef is unable to work due to pigeons.
Minute 
5
5: Chef will do some work.
This is the third minute of work, so the net is put up. The answer is hence 
5
5.
Test case 
2
2: Chef needs 
N
=
5
N=5 minutes and the pigeons will show up every third minute, i.e. minutes 
3
,
6
,
9

…
3,6,9,…
Chef can work on minutes 
1
,
2
,
4
,
5
,
7
1,2,4,5,7 to put up the net; so the answer is 
7
7.

Test case 
3
3: Four minutes are needed, while the pigeons will show up every 
10
10-th minute. The net can be fully put up before the pigeons show up for the first time; needing only 
4
4 minutes.
